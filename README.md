# Project3-Group-3: Food Deserts
## Description
Food deserts are a foundational public health issue of inequality afflicting American cities and communities across the country. The city of Chicago, the third most populous city and metropolitan area in the United States, is one such area which struggles with economic inequality and restrictive access to public services among its community areas. Focusing on Chicago and its community areas, our team is interested in investigating the geographic distribution of food availability in the city.

We want to show exactly how this problem manifests and display with precision the areas which suffer most from the inequality in access to fresh and healthy food options. To this effect, our project's code will use Javascript and HTML to display live maps populated with popups showing the locations of grocery stores, restaurants, and alcoholic vendors to vizualize Chicago's geography accordingly. We will also employ visualizations to execute our project's plan through the use of Python and Pandas dataframes or charts, drawn from our datasets. This project will also store and retrieve our data in a database, such as PostgreSQL, to manage our data in the same server.

Once you navigate to Github pages, you will find the map ready to display. You may find any of the community areas including their name and per capita income by clicking on them. You may interact with the overlays to toggle each of the popup layers on or off. You may click on each popup to see more on the name of each grocery and liquor store location.

## Data Ethics
We aim in this project not to violate any ethical boundaries and to maintain integrity and respect for the privacy of all. No individuals or persons should have been targeted or exposed in this data analysis. All data is provided free courtesy of the City of Chicago's government and is public record for any and all to view and experiment with. Our data contains little to no bias based on false reporting on its factual and actual information. The interpretation of our data, moreover, is fair with respect to the datasets and what they identify as apparent trends. Our analysis, thus, is derived only from the data retrieved and should not be interpreted to contrive a narrative which misrepresents the datasets. Furthermore, our project is in legal compliance with copyright law and legal privacy protections. It will be evident to any who review it that we are within the bounds of the legal frameworks which govern usage of data.
